To put an OpenOffice Spreadsheet under version control, it is more 
efficient to use the Flat XML format instead of the binary ODF 
format. It is then easier to see the diff between two versions, and the
version control software can store only the diffs between successive
versions instead of the full binaries.

However the OpenOffice Spreadsheet Flat XML format records every cell value, 
even those which are computed using a formula from other cell values. 
Therefore a single cell modification usually results in a large portion of 
the file being modified.

Here we provide a simple XML Filter that removes in the stored document 
those cell values which can be derived from a formula. Using this filter 
when a cell value gets modified, only this single modification will 
appear in the diff. We also remove the timestamp and cursor position to 
avoid artificial diffs.

Two installation methods:

1) Installation from package (easier)
In OpenOffice Spreadsheet, simply go to 
Tools => XML Filter Settings => Open Package and install the
oospreadsheetvc.jar file.

2) Installation from xsl file
Copy the odfflatxmlnovalueexport.xsl file somewhere. 
This is the XML filter file. 
To install it in OpenOffice Spreadsheet go to Tools => XML Filter Settings.
Create a new filter with the same content as the existing 
"OpenDocument Spreadsheet Flat XML" filter. Replace the "XSLT for export" 
field with the .xsl file above.
